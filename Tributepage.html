				<p><h4 class="i1">She was born on 14 November 1948 at Pimpri Meghe village in Wardha district Maharashtra to Abhimanji Sathe, a cowherd by profession. Being an unwanted child, she was nicknamed 'Chindhi' (torn piece of cloth). Her father was keen on educating Sindhutai, much against the wishes of her mother. Abhimanji used to send her to school under the pretext of cattle grazing, where she would use 'leaves of Bharadi Tree' as a slate as she could not afford a real slate because of financial reasons. Abject poverty, responsibilities & an early marriage forced her to quit formal education after she passed 4th grade.At the tender age of 12, she got married to Shrihari Sapkal alias Harbaji, whose age more than double a cowherd from Navargaon village in Wardha District.She bore 3 sons by the time she turned 20. She put up a successful agitation against she fought for her self on collection of dried cow dung used as fuel in India.<h4 class="i1">Her agitation brought the district collector to her village and on realizing she was right, he passed an order which the strongman did not like.Stung by the insult at the hands of a poor woman,he managed to convince her husband to abandon her when she was beyond 9 months of her pregnancy. Her husband thrashed her and kicked her on her full term belly and threw her in a cowshed. Tormented and tortured, Sindhutai with her world falling apart, and in great pain, gave birth to a baby girl. Sindhutai cut her umbilical cord with the stone which was lying there and then she passed out. Her husband and other family left her to her destiny. After she came back to her senses she went to her maternal village but everyone shunned her and rejected her. Even her mother closed the doors to her.
